<h1><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h1>

<p>I have hooked up my computer to a
<a
href="http://www.redoctane.com/Guitar-Hero/Xbox-360/Guitar-Hero-World-Tour-Wireless-Guitar-Controller-Xbox-360"><cite>Guitar Hero</cite> controller</a>,
and written software to play
<a href="http://www.rockband.com/"><cite>Rock Band</cite></a>
and <a href="http://www.guitarhero.com/"> <cite>Guitar Hero</cite>.</a>
Why? Well, if you have to ask, you probably wouldn’t get it.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> that this project is many years old and is not compatible with current
versions of Xbox, Windows, Arduino, etc.</p>

<p>I’m not the first to make a  <cite>Guitar Hero</cite> ‘bot.
<s>Here’s one</s><sub><i>dead link</i></sub>
and <a href="http://arduinoguitarhero.blogspot.com/">here’s another</a>.
I’m a software guy and I already have a computer that handles video input (to record TV
shows), so I did most of the work in software. The software should eventually work
with different games. (I have <cite>Rock Band</cite>, <cite>Rock Band 2</cite> and  <cite>Guitar Hero World Tour</cite>.)</p>

<p>The general idea is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The computer receives the game video from the Xbox 360.</li>
<li>Software on the computer analyzes the video to figure out when to play the notes.</li>
<li>The software sends commands via USB to an interface module in the  <cite>Guitar Hero</cite> controller.</li>
<li>The module in the guitar simulates the button presses to play the notes.</li>
</ol>

<p>DaveyBot is named after a fictional  <cite>Guitar Hero</cite>.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p><em>Status (2009-05-10):</em> DaveyBot is up and running! It’s not perfect, though.
The software needs more work.
Currently it plays <cite>Rock Band</cite> and <cite>Rock Band 2</cite> on Expert difficulty.</p>

<h2>Pictures</h2>
<p>There are more pictures, some with annotations,

<h1><a name="software"></a>Software</h1>

<p>The DaveyBot software is written in C#. It uses DirectShow to
capture the video input (via the <a href="http://directshownet.sourceforge.net/">DirectShowNet</a>
C# library). Each video frame is analyzed to see if a note is approaching the
strike line. If so, DaveyBot sends a command out through a comm port, to tell
the guitar to play a note.</p>

<p>Here’s a shot of the DaveyBot software in action with <cite>Rock Band 2</cite>:</p>
<a href="screen1.jpg"><img src="screen1.jpg" alt="screenshot"></a>

<p>The coloured blocks overlaid on the image and above it show
the notes that are detected and played. You can see that the image is quite
blurry. It’s a challenge to get the software to accurately identify the notes. You
may also notice that DaveyBot is losing the game. That’s because it wasn’t
hooked up to a guitar yet!</p>

<p>The note-detection logic isn’t perfect yet. It sometimes misses notes and it
tends to get confused by other things that flash onto the screen.
There’s more work to do before it can play all songs perfectly.</p>

<p>Another challenge was the DirectShow API for video capture (part
of Windows DirectX). I think that API was designed by a Sudoku fanatic who didn’t
want anyone else to use it. I figured out how to navigate the maze
corresponding to my TV tuner card, but I’m not confident that the software would
work on a computer with different video capture hardware.</p>

<p>So far I’ve been using <cite>Rock Band 2</cite> but I should be
able to tweak the software to play  <cite>Guitar Hero</cite> as well. Some of the specialized
features don’t work (solo buttons and slider bar) but I hope to add support for
overdrive/star power.</p>

<h1><a name="arduino"></a>Arduino</h1>

<p>To interpret the commands from the computer and simulate
pressing the buttons, I’m using an <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>
microcontroller embedded in the guitar. Actually I’m using a <a
href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/boarduino/">Boarduino</a> because it’s small
enough to fit in the guitar, it’s powered by the USB connection from the
computer, and its pinout fits nicely on a prototyping board.</p>

<p>The Arduino is connected to the computer via USB, but under
Windows it appears as a serial comm port. The commands sent from the computer
are each a single byte, with each bit representing the on/off state of one of
the switches (fret buttons, strum bar, whammy bar, tilt switch).</p>

<p>The software running on the Arduino is simple. When it
receives a command byte from the computer, it turns the appropriate output pins
on or off. The strum bar is handled specially. It is turned on momentarily, then
off again after a brief time. The whammy bar also needs special handling
because it has to be moved continually, but I haven’t implemented that yet.</p>

<p>Here’s a video of the Boarduino in action, receiving
commands from the computer and driving a set of LEDs in lieu of the guitar
switches:</p>

<h1><a name="hardware"></a>Hardware Interface</h1>

<p>Besides the Boarduino, the interface module in the guitar
also has a set of opto-isolators, to keep the computer and Boarduino electrically
isolated from the guitar controller’s circuitry. I found a pair of quad
optocoupler chips (<a href="https://www.vishay.com/docs/83646/ild1.pdf">ILQ1</a>) that do the trick nicely.</p>

<p>Here’s my schematic for the interface board:</p>
<a href="schematic.png"><img src="schematic.png" alt="schematic"></a>

<p>Here’s what the interface module looks like installed in the guitar controller.
(Click for an annotated version of the picture.)

<p>The outputs from my interface board are connected to the spots on the logic board
where the wires from the guitar’s switches come in. There’s a twisty USB connector bringing
the Boarduino’s USB connection to the outside of the guitar. (If I’d been thinking ahead
I would have just put the Boarduino’s USB connector on a short cable when I put it together.)
There’s also a reset switch for the Boarduino, which is needed to start it running after
it’s plugged into the computer.</p>

<p>When it’s not plugged into the computer, the guitar controller functions normally.</p>

<p>One thing that doesn’t work yet is the whammy bar. It’s not necessary for playing the game,
but it can be used to increase your score. The whammy bar uses a potentiometer hooked up as
a voltage divider, and I haven’t figured out how to control it using an optocoupler.</p>

<p>Here’s how DaveyBot does playing <i>Painkiller</i> on expert difficulty.
Not perfect yet, but quite good.</p>
